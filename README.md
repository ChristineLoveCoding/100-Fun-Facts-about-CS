It is very interesting and friendly-to-learn to a non-cs major, you don't need any prerequisite to learn this courses.

1. The subject Computer Science is built on the top of Math and physics.
2. In the very early stage of Computing Machine, it was huge and warm, it attacked bug. That's why we call there's a "bug" ever since we find an error.
3. Binary, means two states, on and off, true and false.
4. Boolean Logic Operations: NOT(!), AND(&&), OR(||), XOR.
5. 8 bits = 1 byte. For example, 1100 1110 is a byte.
6. One byte can have 256 different numbers.
7. We use the first bit to present the sign: 1 is negative, and 0 is positive, and left bits to present the number itself.
8. For the float pointing data type, in a 32 bit folating number,the first bit is to present the sign of the number, the next 8 bits is to store the exponent, the left bits is to present the significant value itself.
9. We use number to present letters : ASCII code. For example, 97 presents'A'.
10. Unicode is 16 bits, and internationally used by all countries.
11. The ALU is the brain to the computer.(Arithmetic Logic Unit)
